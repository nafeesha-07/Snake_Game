# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Control a snake to eat apples and grow longer.
* **Boundary Wrapping:** The snake can pass through the screen edges and reappear on the opposite side.
* **Self-Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
* **Score Tracking:** Displays the player's score and game time.
* **Game Over Screen:** Provides an option to play again or exit.
* **Random Apple Generation:** Apples spawn randomly within a circular area of the screen.
* **Segmented Snake:** The snake is built from segments, allowing for smooth movement and growth.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## How to Run

1.  **Install Pygame:**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
2.  **Save the Python code** to a file (e.g., `snake_game.py`).
3.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

## Controls

* **Arrow Keys:** Change the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).
* **Escape (Esc):** Exit the game.
* **Y:** Play again after game over.
* **N:** Exit after game over.

## Game Mechanics

* The snake moves continuously in its current direction.
* Eating an apple increases the snake's length and score.
* The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
* The snake can pass through the screen boundaries.

## Code Structure

* `snake_game.py`: Contains the main game logic, including:
    * Game initialization and setup.
    * Snake and apple classes.
    * Collision detection and boundary checks.
    * Game loop and event handling.
    * Score and time display.
    * Game over and play again functions.

## Future Improvements

* Add sound effects and background music.
* Implement different difficulty levels.
* Add more diverse food items with varying scores.
* Create a start screen and menu.
* Improve the visual design and user interface.
* Add power ups.
* Add a high score system.
